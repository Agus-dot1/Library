# Library

## Description

Library is a project developed for The Odin Project. It aims to facilitate the tracking of books that you are currently reading but for now you can't save the information between page reloads.

## Features

- **Add a book**: Clicking the Add book button will create a Book that you can interact with.
- **Edit book information**: You can click the Edit button in any book to change the name, author or description.
- **Delete book**: By clicking the Delet button it will delete the book, this is not reversible.
- **Dark mode**: For those who like it you have a moon button that you can interact to change the theme.
- **Responsive**: Beacause i used Grid to sort the books it works on smaller devices too.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **TailwindCSS**
